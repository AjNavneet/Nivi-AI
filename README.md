Our Paper titled "NIVI-AI: An Agentic Prenatal System for Continuous, Verifiable, and Accountable Obstetric Care" has been accepted in IEEE ICSFT 2025. We will update the repo with developmental code post publication(Q1 2026).

## Research Paper - Abstract

Maternal and fetal mortality rates remain unacceptably high in India and other low-resource settings, particularly in decentralized primary care pathways, where over 70% of pregnancies are monitored through intermittent ANC visits. Current prenatal care is episodic and siloed, often missing early warning signs between clinic visits due to limited continuous monitoring and fragmented record systems. We present NIVI-AI, an “Agentic Prenatal System” designed to provide continuous, multi- domain risk monitoring and verifiable decision support across home, community health workers, and clinical environments. The NIVI-AI integrates four data domains (dense biophysical signals, such as PatchCTG fetal heart rate tracings; periodic vital signs, including BP and glucose from CGM devices; patient-reported symptoms via structured PRO questionnaires; and environmental factors derived from local exposure indices) via a federated One-Agent-Per-Parameter (OAP) multi-agent architecture. A shared Blackboard and Mediator agent perform real-time data fusion and conflict resolution using a DR.KNOWS reasoning layer, whereas a Merkle-automaton trust framework records immutable audit trails for every AI inference and clinician interaction. A Fused Knowledge Core incorporates a clinician curated knowledge graph (via the GynacNet community portal and DR.KNOWS reasoning engine) to ensure explainability and evidence-based alerts aligned with standard obstetric guidelines. In simulation and prototype evaluations using synthetic and limited real-world pilot data, NIVI-AI demonstrated the ability to detect multifactorial obstetric risks earlier than traditional monitoring, particularly for preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and sepsis trajectories. By leveraging decentralized low-cost sensors and cryptographically verifiable alerts validated through federated deployment, NIVI-AI addresses both continuity gaps and the “black-box” trust deficit in current care.
